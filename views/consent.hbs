     <h5>The General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR] and Goldsmiths Research: guidelines for participants</h5>

     <p>
     Please note that this document does not constitute, and should not be construed as, legal advice. These guidelines are designed to help participants understand their rights under GDPR which came into force on 25 May 2018.
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>Your rights as a participant (data subject) in this study</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     The updated data protection regulation is a series of conditions designed to protect an individual's personal data. Not all data collected for research is personal data.
     </p>

     <p>
     Personal data is data such that a living individual can be identified; collection of personal data is sometimes essential in conducting research and GDPR sets out that data subjects should be treated in a lawful and fair manner and that information about the data processing should be explained clearly and transparently. Some data we might ask to collect falls under the heading of <b>special categories data
</b>. This type of information includes data about an individual’s race; ethnic origin; politics; religion; trade union membership; genetics; biometrics (where used for ID purposes); health; sex life; or sexual orientation. This data requires particular care.
     </p>

     <p>
     Under GDPR you have the following rights over your personal data:
     </p>

     <ul>

     <li><b>The right to be informed.</b> You must be informed if your personal data is being used.
     </li>

     <li><b>The right of access.</b> You can ask for a copy of your data by making a ‘subject access request’.
     </li>

     <li><b>The right to rectification.</b> You can ask for your data held to be corrected.
     </li>

     <li><b>The right to erasure.</b> You can ask for your data to be deleted.
     </li>

     <li><b>The right to restrict processing.</b> You shall have the right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing of your data under certain circumstances (e.g., where accuracy of the personal data is contested; see Art. 18 GDPR).
     </li>

     <li><b>The right to data portability.</b> You have the right to get your personal data from an organisation in a way that is accessible and machine-readable. You also have the right to ask an organisation to transfer your data to another organisation.
     </li>

     <li><b>The right to object.</b> You have the right to object to the use of your personal data in some circumstances. You have an absolute right to object to an organisation using your data for direct marketing.
     </li>

     <li><b>How your data is processed using automated decision making and profiling.</b> You have the right not to be subject to a decision that is based solely on automated processing if the decision affects your legal rights or other equally important matters; to understand the reasons behind decisions made about you by automated processing and the possible consequences of the decisions, and to object to profiling in certain situations, including for direct marketing purposes.
     </li>

     </ul>

     <p>
     Please note that these rights are not absolute and only apply in certain circumstances. You should also be informed how long your data will be retained and who it might be shared with.
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>How does Goldsmiths treat my contribution to this study?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Your participation in this research is very valuable and any personal data you provide will be treated in confidence using the best technical means available to us. The university's legal basis for processing your data as part of our research findings is a "task carried out in the public interest". This means that our research is designed to improve the health, happiness and well-being of society and to help us better understand the world we live in. It is not going to be used for marketing or commercial purposes.
     </p>

     <p>
     In addition to our legal basis under Article 6 (as described above), for <b>special categories data</b> as defined under Article 9 of GDPR, our condition for processing is that it is “necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes”.
     </p>

     <p>
     If your data contributes to data from a group then your ability to remove data may be limited as the project progresses, when removal of your data may cause damage to the dataset.
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>You should also know that you may contact any of the following people if you are unhappy about the way your data or your participation in this study are being treated:  </b>
     </p>

     <h5>Study Description</h5>

     <p>
     This study is a BSc Psychology, 3rd-year undergraduate student research project which aims to investigate menopause and the impact it has on reported memory issues. 
     </p>

     <p>
     People's ability to learn and recall new information varies with age and is influenced by brain related conditions. However, little research has been conducted into menopause and the contribution to memory, despite this potentially affecting half the population. Other research has demonstrated how forms of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) could possibly alleviate or reverse memory issues. 
     </p>

     <p>
     Participants will be required to memorise pairs of words and recall them at two later times. This study will <b>not</b> cause any physical or mental harm, so you will <b>not</b> experience any distress whilst participating in this study.
     </p>


     <h5>Data Confidentiality</h5>

     <p>
There is complete anonymity and confidentiality of the data, which will be kept safe electronically. Your personal details such as age and gender will be personally unidentifiable and only seen by the researchers conducting the study. This information will not be shared with any other organisation, and will not be included in any report or other publications arising from the study, and only the results will be kept after the study is completed.

     </p>


     <h5>Who has reviewed the study?</h5>

     Η ικανότητα των ανθρώπων να μαθαίνουν και να ανακαλούν νέες πληροφορίες ποικίλει με την ηλικία και επηρεάζεται από σχετιζόμενες με τον εγκέφαλο καταστάσεις όπως την επιληψία και τη νόσο Alzheimer. Η μελέτη στοχεύει στο να διερευνήσει πώς η μνήμη ποικίλει στο γενικό πληθυσμό. Οι συμμετέχοντες καλούνται να απομνημονεύσουν ζεύγη λέξεων και να τα ανακαλέσουν σε δυο καθυστερημένες συνθήκες. Η μελέτη δε θα επιφέρει σωματικό ή ψυχικό τραύμα, οπότε δε θα βιώσετε αίσθημα δυσφορίας κατά τη συμμετοχή σας στη μελέτη.
     </p>

     <h5>Απόρρητο Δεδομένων</h5>

     Υπάρχει πλήρης ανωνυμία και απόρρητο δεδομένων, τα οποία θα παραμείνουν ασφαλή σε ηλεκτρονική μορφή. Τα προσωπικά σας στοιχεία όπως  η ηλικία και το φύλο θα είναι προσωπικά μη αναγνωρίσιμα και μόνο οι ερευνητές της μελέτης θα μπορούν να έχουν πρόσβαση σε αυτά. Οι πληροφορίες δε θα μοιραστούν με καμία άλλη οργάνωση και δε θα συμπεριληφθούν σε καμία αναφορά ή άλλες δημοσιεύσεις που θα προκύψουν από τη μελέτη και μόνο τα αποτελέσματα θα παραμείνουν αποθηκευμένα μετά την ολοκλήρωση της μελέτης.
     </p>

     <h5>Δικαίωμα αποχώρησης</h5>

     <p>
     Δεν είστε υποχρεωμένοι να λάβετε μέρος στη συγκεκριμένη έρευνα και δεν πρέπει να νιώθετε αναγκασμένοι. Μπορείτε να αποχωρήσετε οποιαδήποτε στιγμή. Εάν επιλέξετε να αποχωρήσετε από τη μελέτη μπορείτε να το κάνετε χωρίς καμία συνέπεια και χωρίς την υποχρέωση να αιτιολογήσετε.
     </p>
