     <p>People's ability to learn and recall new information varies with age, and is influenced by brain related conditions such as epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to show how memory varies within the general population.

Participants are required to memorise pairs of words, and recall them at a later time. 

This study will not cause any physical or mental harm, so you will not experience any distress whilst participating in this study.
