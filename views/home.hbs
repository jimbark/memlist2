     <p><b>
     What is the study about?
     </b></p>

     <p>
     In recent years, society has become aware of an association between long-term involvement in contact sports and the subsequent diagnosis of what is known as ‘chronic traumatic encephalopathy’ (CTE). CTE is associated with the development of dementia and is believed to be caused by the cumulative impact of repeated concussive and sub-concussive events that are sustained over an extended period of time. Unfortunately, since dementia is a progressive condition getting worse over time, it is difficult to tell it apart from the small everyday forgetting that everyone experiences as they get older. At the moment, by the time that someone gets a clinical diagnosis of dementia, the disease has usually got to such a late point that they already have huge difficulties, often needing constant care. This is extremely distressing both for them and their family. To address this huge problem, the Memory, Alzheimer’s and Dementia (MeAD) project at Goldsmiths, University of London is developing a new test to try to diagnose individuals much earlier than current clinical tests are able to.
     </p>

     <p><b>
     Who is carrying out the study?
     </b></p>

     <p>
     The current study is a collaboration with Dr Ashok Jansari & Terry McGibbon from Goldsmiths, University of London, and Isabella Kidd and Dr Michael Gascoigne from the Australian College of Applied Psychology (ACAP). The investigation is based on work that has won Dr Jansari an award for best research in memory disorders from the International Neuropsychological Society. Isabella Kidd, is a 6th year Master of Psychology (Clinical) student at the Australian College of Applied Psychology (ACAP). The research is part of studies toward the Master of Psychology (Clinical) degree. She is working under the supervision of Dr Michael Gascoigne in the Discipline of Psychological Sciences at ACAP. 
     </p>

     <p><b>
     What does the study involve?
     </b></p>

     <p>
     The study will require you to complete an online memory test, which can be accessed via a smartphone or laptop. You will initially spend approximately 30 minutes learning new verbal information; you will then need to return to the study website for only two minutes to test your memory after one hour, and again after 24 hours. 
     </p>

     <p><b>
     How long will the study take?
     </b></p>

     <p>
     It is expected that the overall time commitment for each person will be approximately 40 to 60 minutes across this 24-hour period.
     </p>

     <p><b>
     Will I incur any costs by participating in this study?
     </b></p>

     <p>
     None at all. However if you wish to, you are able to join our prize draw to win one of two $50 gift cards. If you would like to do this, there will be an opportunity to provide us with your email address during the experiment. One participant’s email address will be randomly chosen to receive a $50 gift card at the conclusion of the research study.   
     </p>

     <p><b>
     Are there any risks attached participating in the study?
     </b></p>

     <p>
     The primary risk is that participants may experience distress at the potential for memory loss due to sports participation.  It is important that you assess the risk for yourself after being provided all information about the research, and what risk you may experience and whether it is appropriate for them to take part. In the event of any distress caused, a services sheet below with a list of reputable services you’re able to contact that will provide support.

     <p>
     This Learning and Recall test will form part of the ‘Treatment Seeking Behaviour Study’. However, by completing this test, you will also contribute to the MeAD project.
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>What is MeAD and how will it help?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     The MeAD project at Goldsmiths, University of London is developing a new test to try to diagnose individuals <b>much earlier</b> than current clinical tests are able to. If we can diagnose dementia earlier in the disease, then we can support the patient much more and (with the hopeful development of drug treatments aimed at stopping the progress of the disease) preserve more of their memory, their sense of self and overall quality of life – this will also reduce the awful distress felt by all the family who are seeing their loved one fade away before them….
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>How you can help</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     To help in our project, we need people of <b>all ages</b> to take part in the MeAD project to see how our memory develops through life and how it changes as we get older. Once we know how <b>healthy ageing</b> affects memory, we will be able to see what happens in dementia and therefore develop better tests for clinical diagnosis. Importantly, we are looking for all levels of memory, so do not worry if your memory is one of the better ones, worse ones, or just ‘average’ - we need you all &#128515;

     <h4 class="pt-3">Welcome to the Memory & Sport Project!</h4>

     <p class="pt-3">
     Are you aged 18 or over and can you spare 30 minutes to help with an exciting international study investigating the impact of playing sports on memory?
     <p>

     <p>
     Would you like an individualised report showing how your memory compares to other people who participate in our study?
     <p>

     <p>
     <b>What is this study about?</b>
     <p>

     <p>
     Playing sports, and exercise more generally, is beneficial for many aspects of health. Indeed, exercise has been shown to reduce risk of major diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and depression.
     </p>

     <p>
     There is also evidence exercise can be beneficial for brain function, and specifically, memory. It has even been shown to reduce the risk of developing dementia.
     </p>

     <p>
     There is a growing body of research linking participation in contact sports, including rugby, to dementias and CTE. However, the current research and media focus is on male professional athletes. There is a lack of research collecting data from women who play rugby, despite the growing popularity and participation levels. This study aims to collect data from all levels of the adult game, both males and females.
     </p>    

     <p>
     To help us better understand the impact of sports on memory our team at Goldsmiths, University of London has developed a simple online test to measure memory performance, so that anyone can take part. The current study is being conducted by MSc student Niamh Mitchell, under the supervision of neuropsychologist Dr Ashok Jansari.
     </p>


     <p>
     <b>How you can help</b>
     <p>

     <p>
     As long as you are over  18, you can help - we need as many people as possible, of all ages.
     </p>

     <p>
     Even if you DON’T play sports, you can participate - for the study, we need BOTH people who play any form of sports and those who don’t so that we can compare between the two, and compare across sports.
     </p>

     <p>
     Whilst we are also highlighting the lack of research in the women’s game, we also need male participants. There is a need to investigate all levels of adult rugby. 
     </p>

     <p>
     Importantly, we are looking for ALL levels of memory, so do not worry if your memory is one of the better ones, worse ones, or just 'average' - we are interested in all of you &#128515;
     </p>

     <p>
     As well as taking part yourself, you can also help by sharing details of this study with anyone else who you think might be interested in taking part – the more people that take part, the more useful our results will be.  
     </p>

     <p>


     <p>
     <b>What taking part requires</b>
     </p>

     <p>Participants are required to memorise pairs of words, and recall them at two later times.
     </p>

     <p>
     The test will take around 30 minutes in total, which includes two recall tasks, one after 55 minutes and one in 24 hours time.

     </p>

     <p><b>
     How big a problem is CTE?
     </p></b>

     <p>
     CTE may impact many people that have participated in contact sports, such as American Football, soccer or association football, Australian Rules Football, and others. Historically, the disease has been associated with boxers that displayed major behavioral and cognitive changes after boxing. CTE is usually caused by repeated contact to the head that adds up in creating damage to the brain and can transform into dementia, a cognitive disorder that is typically associated with severe memory issues that influence one’s ability to function daily. CTE also affects one’s decision making and can lead to undesirable behaviors. Aaron Hernandez is an example of an American Football player that had CTE. He was convicted of murder and then took his own life and after an autopsy was done, he was shown to have Stage 3 CTE. Unfortunately, in most cases the disease is unable to be diagnosed until after death and the impact is very much lasting in those that deal with it.
     </p>

     <p><b>
     What is the Memory and Sports Project and how will it help?
     </p></b>

     <p>
     To address this huge problem, the Memory and Sports Project at Goldsmiths, University of London is developing a new test to try to diagnose individuals <b>much earlier</b> than current clinical tests are able to. If we can diagnose or identify important markers of CTE earlier in the disease, then we can support the patient much more and preserve more of their memory, their sense of self, and overall quality of life. Also, the test will allow for more understanding of CTE and correctly identify symptoms of the disease and not get it confused with something similar such as concussions. The test will hopefully assist in identifying markers of CTE that can be addressed when examining people that have had repeated blows to the head over a long period of time. This test will hopefully provide numerous amounts of information about CTE and its risk factors. This will also reduce the significant distress felt by friends and family who are seeing their loved one change drastically before their eyes…
     </p>

     <p><b>
     How can you help?
     </p></b>

     <p>
     To help in our project, we need people of <b>all ages and sports as well as those that do not play sports</b> to take part in the Memory and Sports Project to see how our memory develops through life and how participating in sports affects memory. Knowing how <b>healthy ageing without sport</b> affects memory, we can build more knowledge of how sport impacts memory. Then seeing how <b>healthy ageing with sport</b> affects memory, we will be able to see what happens in CTE and therefore develop better tests for clinical diagnosis. Having multiple types of sports and levels of involvement in sports will assist in identifying what areas of sport may influence memory. We are looking for all levels of memory as well, so do not worry if your memory is one of the better ones, worse ones, or just ‘average’ - we need you all &#128515;
     </p>

     <p>
     Are you aged <b>18 or over</b> and can take part in an exciting international study on memory and menopause? 
     </p>

     <p>
     Most people know what memory is, that it is important and that without it, we simply wouldn’t be who we are. Whether you’re 18 or 99, each person requires memory to get by in day-to-day life. To put it simply, we often don’t realise the importance of our memory functions, until they start to fade, and that can be noticed in as early as your 20s.
      </p>

     <p>
     A large area with very <b>little</b> research, is that of menopause and associated cognitive difficulties. Every person is ultimately affected by menopausal memory struggles, whether directly or indirectly. This area requires a lot more attention than it is currently receiving. With millions of women all around the world suffering with memory loss, it is more important than ever to investigate how current treatment like HRT may be involved.

     We need <b>women and men</b> of all ages to assist in the investigation of the impact that menopause has on memory. 
     </p>

     <p><b>
     Why memory and menopause?
     </b></p>

     <p>
     Before the full onset of menopause there is a stage known as <b>perimenopause</b>. This can last for 4 to 5 years or longer, where the onset of many memory difficulties can begin. This makes it vital to study <b>all ages</b> and not just those going through menopause. 
     </p>

     <p>
     Most women can agree, the symptoms of menopause are debilitating and more often, these  are ignored. One of the most prominent subjects that are continually downplayed are all the cognitive issues like <b>memory difficulties</b>.
     </p>

     <p><b>
     So, what is this and how can I help?
     </b></p>

     <p>
     A team at Goldsmiths, University of London, led by Dr Ashok Jansari are doing research to attempt to understand these memory problems by using the various stages of menopause. 
     </p>

     <p>
     To help in our project, we need people of <b>all ages</b>(over 18) to investigate the links between perimenopause/menopausal stages and memory difficulties. 
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>You would also be helping us</b> by sharing this study with anyone that might be interested in taking part – the more people that take part, the more useful our results will be!

     <h4 class="pt-3">Welcome to the Memory, Alzheimer’s and Dementia (MeAD) Project!</h4>

     <p>
     Are you aged 16 or over and can you spare 30 minutes to help with an exciting international study on memory and play a part in helping us diagnose Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia much more efficiently than currently possible? Would you like to find out how your memory compares to others your own age?
     </p>


     <p>
     <b>How big a problem is dementia?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Currently, globally there are about 50 million people living with dementia and this is set to rise to 75 million by 2030; at the moment, this is costing society <b>$1,000,000,000,000</b> (one trillion dollars) and this is projected to double by 2030. Unfortunately, since dementia is a progressive condition getting worse over time, it is difficult to tell it apart from the small everyday forgetting that everyone experiences as they get older. At the moment, by the time that someone gets a clinical diagnosis of dementia, the disease has usually got to such a late point that they already have huge difficulties, often needing constant care. This is extremely distressing both for them and their family. 
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>What is MeAD and how will it help?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     To address this huge problem, the MeAD project at Goldsmiths, University of London is developing a new test to try to diagnose individuals <b>much earlier</b> than current clinical tests are able to. If we can diagnose dementia earlier in the disease, then we can support the patient much more and (with the hopeful development of drug treatments aimed at stopping the progress of the disease) preserve more of their memory, their sense of self and overall quality of life – this will also reduce the awful distress felt by all the family who are seeing their loved one fade away before them….
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>How you can help</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     To help in our project, we need people of <b>all ages</b> to take part in the MeAD project to see how our memory develops through life and how it changes as we get older. Once we know how <b>healthy ageing</b> affects memory, we will be able to see what happens in dementia and therefore develop better tests for clinical diagnosis. Importantly, we are looking for all levels of memory, so do not worry if your memory is one of the better ones, worse ones, or just ‘average’ - we need you all &#128515;  
     </p>

     <p>
     You can also help by sharing if you know anyone that would be interested in taking part in the project – the more people that take part, the more useful our results will be for trying to help people with dementia. 
     </p>

     <p>
     Please feel free to get in contact with the lead researchers if you have any questions.

     <b>Πόσο μεγάλο πρόβλημα είναι η άνοια;</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Αυτήν τη στιγμή, διεθνώς υπάρχουν περίπου 50 εκατομμύρια άνθρωποι που ζουν με άνοια και αναμένεται να αυξηθούν στα 75 εκατομμύρια έως το 2030: Αυτήν τη στιγμή αυτό κοστίζει $1,000,000,000,000  (ένα τρισεκατομμύριο δολάρια) και αναμένεται αυτό το ποσό να διπλασιαστεί μέχρι το 2030. Δυστυχώς, από τη στιγμή που η άνοια είναι μια προοδευτική κατάσταση που χειροτερεύει με το χρόνο, είναι δύσκολο να τη διακρίνεις από το σύνηθες φαινόμενο του να ξεχνάμε καθημερινά όσο μεγαλώνουμε. Αυτήν τη στιγμή, έως τη στιγμή που κάποιος λαμβάνει την κλινική διάγνωση της άνοιας, η νόσος έχει φτάσει σε τέτοιο σημείο που παρουσιάζονται τεράστιες δυσκολίες και απαιτείται άμεση βοήθεια. Αυτό είναι εξαιρετικά πιεστικό για τους ίδιους και για την οικογένειά τους.
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>Τι είναι το ΜΑΑ και πώς θα βοηθήσει;</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Για να αντιμετωπίσει αυτό το τεράστιο πρόβλημα, το έργο ΜΑΑ του Goldsmiths, University of London αναπτύσσει ένα νέο τεστ για να προσπαθήσει να κάνει διάγνωση σε άτομα πολύ νωρίτερα από τα τωρινά κλινικά τεστ που είναι διαθέσιμα. Εάν μπορούμε να κάνουμε διάγνωση της άνοιας νωρίτερα στο πλαίσιο της ασθένειας, τότε μπορούμε να υποστηρίξουμε τον ασθενή πολύ περισσότερο και (με την υποσχόμενη ανάπτυξη της φαρμακοθεραπείας που στοχεύει στο να σταματήσει την ανάπτυξη της νόσου) και να διατηρήσει περισσότερο τη μνήμη του, την αίσθηση του εαυτού και τη γενικότερη ποιότητα ζωής – αυτό θα μειώσει τη θλίψη που αισθάνονται τα μέλη της οικογένειας που βλέπουν τον αγαπημένο τους άνθρωπο να εξαφανίζεται μπροστά τους…
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>Πώς μπορείς να βοηθήσεις</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Για να μας βοηθήσετε στο έργο μας, χρειαζόμαστε ανθρώπους όλων των ηλικιών για να λάβουν μέρος στο ΜΑΑ ώστε να δούμε πώς η μνήμη αναπτύσσεται στη διάρκεια της ζωής και πώς αλλάζει όσο μεγαλώνουμε. Εφόσον γνωρίζουμε πώς το φυσιολογικό γήρας επιδρά στη μνήμη θα είμαστε σε θέση να γνωρίζουμε τι συμβαίνει στην άνοια και, συνεπώς, να αναπτύξουμε καλύτερα τεστ για την κλινική διάγνωση. Σημειωτέον, αναζητούμε όλα τα επίπεδα της μνήμης, οπότε μην ανησυχείτε εάν η μνήμη σας είναι μια από τις καλύτερες, τις χειρότερες ή τις «μεσαίες» - σας χρειαζόμαστε όλους σε αυτό μας το έργο &#128515;

     <h4 class="pt-3">Welcome to the Memory, Alzheimer’s and Dementia (MeAD) Project!</h4>

     <p>
     <b>Introduction</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     I would like to cordially invite you to take part in my MSc project, which aims to investigate how memory differs within the general population. This study has been reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee at Goldsmiths, University of London, and will be online. Please take the time to read the following information. You will need to indicate that you have fully understood the information before taking part in this study.
     </p>

     <p>
     Please ensure the following criteria apply, to be eligible to take part in this study:
     </p>

     <ul>
     <li>Aged 16 or over </li>
     <li>Can spare 30 minutes of your time to participate</li>
     </ul>

     <p>
     <b>Why dementia?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    Dementia is a syndrome that involves an acquired loss of cognition in various cognitive domains, particularly severe to affect social or occupational function. <b>In the UK, 850,000 people have been diagnosed with dementia.</b> The global number of people with dementia is estimated to increase to 74.7 million by 2030. However, those patients who pass all standard clinical memory tests can still suffer from significant long-term memory impairment. Dementia is becoming a significant public health concern in developing societies and with the increase in the ageing population, the number of people who are diagnosed with dementia continues to progress.
    </p>	 

    <p>
    <b>What is the purpose of the study?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    The MeAD project at Goldsmiths, University of London are establishing a new test to help diagnose individuals much earlier than standard clinical tests of memory. With the increasing popularity of sports worldwide, greater attention has been paid to sport-related head injuries.    </p>

    <p>
    Your contribution is highly valued as it can help identify individuals who are at risk of developing dementia in the future. If this was the case, this would help clinicians work with individuals to reduce the difficulties that they will experience as the disease progresses. Once we know how healthy aging affects memory, we will be able to see what happens in dementia and therefore develop better tests for clinical diagnosis.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Why we need your help?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    We are looking for people of all ages and levels of memory to take part in the MeAD project to see how our memory develops through life and how it changes as we get older. Please do not feel discouraged with how well you perform, whether your memory is better or worse than others. Your participation can make a huge difference as there will be time for the most appropriate care and advice to be provided. The earlier a diagnosis is made, the more effective a treatment can be because the brain is likely to have suffered less damage in the earlier stages of the disease. It will allow those with early-onset dementia to make plans for the future to make arrangements that may not be possible once dementia has progressed.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Do I have to take part?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    Under no circumstance do you have to participate. There will be no adverse consequence in terms of your legal rights if you participate in this study. Please feel free to provide your honest responses. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>What are the risks and benefits of taking part?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    The benefit of being involved in this experiment is that if we can diagnose dementia early in the disease, it can allow the person and family to attribute cognitive changes to the disease rather than to personal failing and preserve the person’s dignity throughout the disease process. Also, an early diagnosis can help persevere more of their memory through early-stage support groups and improved care to better manage and cope with the symptoms. There are no significant risks involved in this study that are beyond those you would encounter in everyday life.  In the case of feeling distressed from answering a specific question, you may leave it blank.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Will my taking part in this study be kept confidential?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    All information which is collected about you in this study will remain strictly confidential. Only the researchers will have access to the information. Your data will be treated in a lawful and fair manner. Some data we might ask to collect falls under the heading of special categories data.

All personal data will be securely kept in password-protected folders and will not be disclosed to unauthorised persons. The data will remain private and confidential. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Personal data will be handled under the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) 2018 and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA).  The research study is designed to improve dementia research and help aid the early diagnosis of dementia to help us better understand the world we live in. It is not going to be used for marketing or commercial purposes. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>What will happen to the results of this research study?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    The results will be included in the project’s report. You will <u>NOT</u> be referred to by name in any report concerning the study. You will be provided with a unique code that you are required to write down and you will need this when you come back for your delayed test.
    </p>

    <p>
    All data will be deleted when the dissertation project has been marked, under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) right to erasure. Anonymised data collected from you will be stored securely for conference presentations and the project report.

     Jeśli ma Pan/i 16 lat lub więcej i może poświęcić 30 minut, to zapraszamy do wzięcia udziału w niezwykle ciekawym międzynarodowym badaniu, dotyczącym pamięci i zapominania. Jego wyniki mogą pomóc w lepszym diagnozowaniu choroby Alzheimera i różnych form demencji znacznie skuteczniej niż obecnie.
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>Jak dużym problemem jest demencja?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Obecnie na całym świecie na demencję choruje około 50 milionów ludzi, a do 2030 roku liczba ta ma wzrosnąć do 75 milionów. Z powodu tej choroby koszty, które ponosi społeczeństwo szacuje się na<b> 1 000 000 000 000 (bilion) dolarów amerykańskich</b>, a w 2030 roku kwota ta może się podwoić. Niestety, ze względu na to, że demencja jest chorobą postępującą (co oznacza, że pogarsza się z czasem), trudno jest odróżnić jej objawy od łagodnego i codziennego zapominania, które pojawia się wraz z wiekiem. Zazwyczaj rozpoznawana jest zbyt późno, kiedy osoba chora już doświadcza poważnych trudności i wymaga stałej opieki, co jest niezwykle przygnębiające dla niej i jej rodziny.
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>Co to jest PCAiD i jak to badanie może pomóc?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     W celu rozwiązania tego ogromnego problemu, w ramach badania PCAiD realizowanego przez College’u Goldsmiths Uniwersytetu w Londynie opracowano nowy test, który może pomóc w rozpoznawaniu zaburzeń pamięci i zapominania znacznie wcześniej niż obecnie dostępne testy kliniczne. Wczesne rozpoznanie choroby pozwoli na szybsze wprowadzenie odpowiednich form wsparcia dla osób chorych (z nadzieją na opracowanie leków mających na celu zatrzymanie postępu choroby), co może przełożyć się na zachowanie dobrej sprawności pamięci, wyższe poczucie siebie i podniesienie jakości życia - a także zmniejszenie cierpienia, jakie odczuwają osoby chore i ich rodziny.
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>Jak Pan/i może pomóc?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Do udziału w badaniu PCAiD poszukujemy osób w każdym wieku, powyżej 16 lat, aby sprawdzić jak rozwija się pamięć w życiu człowieka i jak zmienia się wraz z wiekiem. Jeśli dowiemy się, jak “zdrowe starzenie się” wpływa na pamięć, będziemy mogli lepiej określić zmiany spowodowane demencją, a tym samym opracować bardziej odpowiedni testy do diagnozy klinicznej. Poszukujemy osób o różnym poziomie sprawności w zakresie pamięci. Nie musi się Pan/i martwić, że ma Pan/i lepszą, przeciętną czy gorszą pamięć - każda osoba będzie dla nas pomocna.
     </p>

     <p>
     Może Pan/i również pomóc, zapraszając inne osoby do wzięcia udziału w badaniu - im więcej osób weźmie w nim udział, tym w większym stopniu uzyskane wyniki będą przydatne aby pomóc osobom z demencją.
     </p>

     <p>
     Jeśli ma Pan/i jakiekolwiek pytania, prosimy skontaktować się z głównymi badaczami.
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>Biorę udział.</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Prosimy o zaznaczenie czy uczestniczy Pan/i w badaniu pierwszy raz czy ponownie.
     </p>

     <p>
     Z góry dziękujemy!

     <p>
     Hai 16 anni o più? Hai mezz’ora da dedicare ad uno studio internazionale sulla memoria e vuoi aiutarci a raggiungere il nostro scopo di diagnosticare l’Alzheimer e altre forme di demenza in modo molto più efficace di quello attuale?
     </p>


     <p>
     <b>Qual è l’impatto della demenza?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Attualmente, all’incirca 50 milioni di persone al mondo sono colpite dalla demenza, e si stima un incremento di questo numero che porterà a 75 milioni di persone nel 2030. Dal punto di vista economico, questa malattia comporta una spesa mondiale di <b>$1,000,000,000,000</b> (un trilione di dollari) che arriverà a raddoppiare nel 2030. Purtroppo, la demenza è una condizione degenerativa che peggiora con il tempo, ed è difficile distinguerla da piccole dimenticanze che è normale che aumentino nel corso degli anni e con il progredire dell’età. Attualmente, si arriva a diagnosticare ufficialmente la malattia quando il paziente è in uno stadio avanzato in cui le difficoltà sono già molte e l’autonomia fortemente limitata. Questa diagnosi tardiva ha un fortissimo impatto psicologico ed emotivo sui pazienti e sui loro cari.
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>In che cosa consiste il MeAD e come può aiutare?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Per affrontare questo problema, il progetto MeAD che si sta svolgendo presso l’Università di Goldsmiths, a Londra, ha lo scopo di sviluppare un nuovo strumento diagnostico per anticipare significativamente la diagnosi di demenza rispetto agli attuali test clinici a disposizione. Una diagnosi precoce contribuirebbe a un maggiore supporto del paziente sin dalle prime fasi della malattia e, nella speranza che nel frattempo la ricerca in ambito farmacologico faccia progressi nello sviluppare farmaci volti a fermare o rallentare la degenerazione, preservare il più possibile non solo la memoria di questi pazienti ma soprattutto la loro dignità e qualità di vita. Ciò ridurrebbe anche le drammatiche conseguenze emotive causate dal vedere i propri cari perdere sé stessi e il contatto con il mondo che li circonda. 
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>E tu, come puoi aiutare?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Abbiamo bisogno che persone di <b>tutte le età</b> partecipino al nostro progetto MeAD per raggiungere il nostro scopo, che è quello di osservare l’evoluzione della memoria nel corso della vita e come si modifica con l’avanzare dell’invecchiamento. Analizzare come cambia la memoria nel corso di un sano invecchiamento ci fornirà gli strumenti per comprendere ciò che accade con la demenza e di conseguenza sviluppare strumenti volti a una più precisa e tempestiva diagnosi clinica. Ci teniamo a specificare che siamo interessati a una vasta gamma di ‘capacità’, quindi indipendentemente da come consideri la tua memoria, che sia ottima, abbastanza buona, o se pensi che non lo sia per niente, in tutti e tre i casi abbiamo bisogno di te &#128515;
     </p>

     <p>
     Puoi anche aiutarci condividendo la nostra ricerca con chiunque pensi possa essere interessato – più siamo, e più utili saranno i nostri risultati nell’aiutare coloro affetti da demenza. 
     </p>

     <p>
     Non esitare a contattare i responsabili della ricerca se ci sono dubbi o domande.

     Avez-vous 16 ans ou plus et pouvez-vous consacrer 30 minutes à une étude internationale passionnante sur la mémoire et contribuer à nous aider à diagnostiquer la maladie d'Alzheimer et d'autres formes de démence beaucoup plus efficacement que ce qui est actuellement possible?
     </p>


     <p>
     <b>Quelle est l'ampleur du problème de la démence?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     À l'heure actuelle, environ 50 millions de personnes dans le monde sont atteintes de démence et ce chiffre devrait passer à 75 millions en 2030 ; actuellement, cette maladie coûte à la société 1 000 000 000 000 (un trillion de dollars) et ce chiffre devrait doubler d'ici à 2030. Malheureusement, comme la démence est une maladie progressive qui s'aggrave avec le temps, il est difficile de la distinguer des petits oublis quotidiens que chacun connaît en vieillissant. Actuellement, lorsqu'une personne reçoit un diagnostic clinique de démence, la maladie a généralement déjà atteint un stade tellement avancé qu'elle éprouve déjà d'énormes difficultés, nécessitant souvent des soins constants. Cette situation est extrêmement bouleversante, tant pour la personne concernée que pour sa famille.
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>Qu'est-ce que MeAD et comment cela peut-il aider?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Pour essayer de résoudre cet énorme problème, le projet MeAD de l'université Goldsmiths de Londres met au point un nouveau test pour tenter de diagnostiquer les personnes concernées <b>beaucoup plus tôt</b> que ne le permettent les tests cliniques actuels. Si nous parvenons à diagnostiquer la démence à un stade plus précoce de la maladie, nous pourrons soutenir davantage le patient et (avec l'espoir du développement de traitements médicamenteux qui visent à arrêter la progression de la maladie) préserver davantage sa mémoire, son sentiment d'identité et sa qualité de vie globale. Cela réduira également l'horrible détresse ressentie par toutes les familles qui voient leur proche s'éteindre devant elles...
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>Comment pouvez-vous aider?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Pour nous aider dans notre projet, nous avons besoin de personnes de <b>tout âges</b> pour participer au projet MeAD afin de voir comment notre mémoire se développe au cours de la vie et comment elle change avec l'âge. Une fois que nous saurons comment le <b>vieillissement sain</b> affecte la mémoire, nous serons en mesure de voir ce qui se passe dans la démence et donc de développer de meilleurs tests pour le diagnostic clinique. Il est important de noter que nous recherchons tous les niveaux de mémoire, alors ne vous inquiétez pas si votre mémoire est meilleure, moins bonne ou simplement "moyenne" - nous avons besoin de vous tous &#128515;. 
     </p>

     <p>
     Vous pouvez également nous aider en nous faisant savoir si vous connaissez quelqu'un qui serait intéressé de participer au projet. Plus il y aura de participants, plus nos résultats seront utiles pour tenter d'aider les personnes atteintes de démence.
     </p>

     <p>
     Are you aged 16 or over and can you spare 30 minutes to help with an exciting international study on memory and play a part in helping us diagnose Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia much more efficiently than currently possible? 
     </p>


     <p>
     <b>How big a problem is dementia?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Currently, globally there are about 50 million people living with dementia and this is set to rise to 75 million by 2030; at the moment, this is costing society <b>$1,000,000,000,000</b> (one trillion dollars) and this is projected to double by 2030. Unfortunately, since dementia is a progressive condition getting worse over time, it is difficult to tell it apart from the small everyday forgetting that everyone experiences as they get older. At the moment, by the time that someone gets a clinical diagnosis of dementia, the disease has usually got to such a late point that they already have huge difficulties, often needing constant care. This is extremely distressing both for them and their family. 
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>What is MeAD and how will it help?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     To address this huge problem, the MeAD project at Goldsmiths, University of London is developing a new test to try to diagnose individuals <b>much earlier</b> than current clinical tests are able to. If we can diagnose dementia earlier in the disease, then we can support the patient much more and (with the hopeful development of drug treatments aimed at stopping the progress of the disease) preserve more of their memory, their sense of self and overall quality of life – this will also reduce the awful distress felt by all the family who are seeing their loved one fade away before them….
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>How you can help</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     To help in our project, we need people of <b>all ages</b> to take part in the MeAD project to see how our memory develops through life and how it changes as we get older. Once we know how <b>healthy ageing</b> affects memory, we will be able to see what happens in dementia and therefore develop better tests for clinical diagnosis. Importantly, we are looking for all levels of memory, so do not worry if your memory is one of the better ones, worse ones, or just ‘average’ - we need you all &#128515;  
     </p>

     <p>
     You can also help by sharing if you know anyone that would be interested in taking part in the project – the more people that take part, the more useful our results will be for trying to help people with dementia.
     </p>

     <p>
     Please feel free to get in contact with the lead researchers if you have any questions.
     </p>


     <p>
     <b>Take part.</b>
     </p>

     <p>To get started first tell us whether you are a new participant, or a returning participant.

     Er du 16 år eller over og kan du avse 30 minutter til en spennende internasjonal studie om minne, og hjelpe oss i å diagnostisere Alzheimers og andre former for demens mer effektivt enn vi kan i dag? 
     </p>


     <p>
     <b>Hvor stort problem er demens? </b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Globalt er det rundt 50 millioner personer som i dag lever med demens, og dette tallet er estimert til 75 millioner innen 2030. Akkurat nå koster dette dagens samfunn <b>$1,000,000,000,000</b> (en billion dollar), og det er anslått at dette tallet vil fordobles innen 2030. Dessverre er demens er en progressiv sykdom som blir verre over tid, og er derfor vanskelig å skille fra hverdagslig glemsel som alle vil oppleve etter som man blir eldre. For øyeblikket, innen noen får demens som en klinisk diagnose, har sykdommen allerede utviklet seg over lengre tid hvor de allerede har store vanskeligheter, og konstant pleie trengs. Dette er ofte veldig vanskelig både for individet selv, og deres familie. 
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>Hva er MeAD og hvordan vil det hjelpe?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     For å prøve å løse dette problemet, utvikler MeAD-prosjektet ved Goldsmiths, University of London en ny test, med hensikt å diagnostisere individer tidligere enn det dagens kliniske tester er i stand til. Hvis vi har muligheten til å diagnostisere demens tidligere i sykdomsforløpet, vil vi kunne by på bedre oppfølging (med den håpefulle utviklingen av medikamentell behandling som tar sikte på å stoppe sykdommens fremgang), bevare mer av minnet/hukommelsen, følelsen av å kunne være seg selv, og den generelle kvaliteten på livet- dette vil også kunne redusere vanskeligheten familien føler ved å se sin kjære forsvinne foran dem…
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>Hvordan du kan hjelpe</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     For å hjelpe, trenger vi personer i alle aldre til å ta del i MeAD-prosjektet for å se hvordan hukommelsen vår utvikler seg i løpet av livet, og hvordan den endrer seg ettersom vi blir eldre. Når vi vet hvordan sunn aldring påvirker hukommelsen, vil vi kunne bedre se hva som skjer med hukommelsen ved demens, og deretter utvikle bedre tester for klinisk diagnostisering. Legg merke til, vi ser etter alle nivåer av hukommelse, så ikke vær bekymret om din er en av de bedre, verre, eller helt «gjennomsnittlig» - vi trenger dere alle &#128515;
     </p>

     <p>
     Du kan også hjelpe ved å dele prosjektet hvis du kjenner noen som kan være interessert i å ta del- jo flere som deltar, jo nyttigere vil resultatet være for å prøve å hjelpe personer med demens.

     <h4 class="pt-3">Welcome to the Memory Project!</h4>

     <p>
     Are you aged 16 or over and can you spare 30 minutes to help with an exciting international study on memory? Would you like to find out how your memory compares to that of an international sample?
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>Memory stats</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     We have on average 70,000 thoughts a day and encounter 1 quadrillion pieces of information over the course of our lifetime. Some people are better at remembering all of these thoughts and pieces of information than others. Interestingly, a rare percentage of the world population has Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory (HSAM) and can accurately recall most everything they have experienced in their lifetime! Whether you think you know how good your memory is or not, take this test and find out where you lie on the Memory Spectrum.
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>How you can help</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     To help in the project, we need people of all ages to see how our memory develops through life and how it changes as we get older. Importantly, we are looking for all levels of memory, so do not worry if your memory is one of the better ones, worse ones, or just “average” - we need you all! &#128515;  
     </p>

     <p>
     As well as taking part yourself, you can also help by sharing details of this study if you know anyone that would be interested in taking part – the more people that take part, the more useful our results will be. 
     </p>

     <p>
     If you complete all stages you will be able to request an individualised report showing how your memory compares to other people who participate in our study.
     </p>

     <p>
     Please feel free to get in contact with the lead researchers if you have any questions.
     </p>


     <p>
     <b>Take part.</b>
     </p>

     <p>To get started first tell us whether you are a new participant, or a returning participant.

     <p>
     Are you aged 16 or over and can you spare 30 minutes to help with an exciting international study on memory and play a part in helping us diagnose Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia much more efficiently than currently possible? 
     </p>


     <p>
     <b>How big a problem is dementia?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     Currently, globally there are about 50 million people living with dementia and this is set to rise to 75 million by 2030; at the moment, this is costing society <b>$1,000,000,000,000</b> (one trillion dollars) and this is projected to double by 2030. Unfortunately, since dementia is a progressive condition getting worse over time, it is difficult to tell it apart from the small everyday forgetting that everyone experiences as they get older. At the moment, by the time that someone gets a clinical diagnosis of dementia, the disease has usually got to such a late point that they already have huge difficulties, often needing constant care. This is extremely distressing both for them and their family. 
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>What is MeAD and how will it help?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     To address this huge problem, the MeAD project at Goldsmiths, University of London is developing a new test to try to diagnose individuals <b>much earlier</b> than current clinical tests are able to. If we can diagnose dementia earlier in the disease, then we can support the patient much more and (with the hopeful development of drug treatments aimed at stopping the progress of the disease) preserve more of their memory, their sense of self and overall quality of life – this will also reduce the significant distress felt by all the family who are seeing their loved one fade away before them….
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>How you can help</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     To help in our project, we need people of <b>all ages</b> to take part in the MeAD project to see how our memory develops through life and how it changes as we get older. Once we know how <b>healthy ageing</b> affects memory, we will be able to see what happens in dementia and therefore develop better tests for clinical diagnosis.

At the moment, by the time that someone gets a clinical diagnosis of dementia, the disease has usually got to such a late point that they already have huge difficulties, often needing constant care. This is extremely distressing both for them and their family. 
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>What is MeAD and how will it help?</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     To address this huge problem, the MeAD project at Goldsmiths, University of London is developing a new test to try to diagnose individuals <b>much earlier</b> than current clinical tests are able to. If we can diagnose dementia earlier in the disease, then we can support the patient much more and (with the hopeful development of drug treatments aimed at stopping the progress of the disease) preserve more of their memory, their sense of self and overall quality of life – this will also reduce the awful distress felt by all the family who are seeing their loved one fade away before them….
     </p>

     <p>
     <b>How you can help</b>
     </p>

     <p>
     To help in our project, we need people of <b>all ages</b> to take part in the MeAD project to see how our memory develops through life and how it changes as we get older. Once we know how <b>healthy ageing</b> affects memory, we will be able to see what happens in dementia and therefore develop better tests for clinical diagnosis. Importantly, we are looking for all levels of memory, so do not worry if your memory is one of the better ones, worse ones, or just ‘average’ - we need you all &#128515;  
     </p>

     <p>
     You can also help by sharing if you know anyone that would be interested in taking part in the project – the more people that take part, the more useful our results will be for trying to help people with dementia.

     <h4 class="pt-3">Welcome to the Memory Project!</h4>

     <p class="pt-3">
     <b>Are you:</b>
     <p>

     <ul>
	<li>Over 16?
	<li>Interested in finding out how good your memory is compared to other people your age?
     </ul>

     <p>
     <b>Do you:</b>
     <p>

     <ul>
	<li>Want to learn how to improve your memory?
	<li>Have 30 minutes to spare over the next 24 hours?
     </ul>

     <p>
     <b>What is this about?</b>
     <p>

     <ul>
        <li>
	To help us better understand how memory varies across our lifespan our team at Goldsmiths, University of London has developed a simple online test to measure memory performance. We now need as many people as possible of all ages to take part.
     </ul>

     <p>
     <b>How can you help?</b>
     <p>

     <ul>
        <li>As long as you are over 16, you can help - we need as many people as possible, of all ages.
	<li>Importantly, we are looking for ALL levels of memory, so do not worry if your memory is one of the better ones, worse ones, or just ‘average’ - we need you all &#128515;
	<li>As well as taking part yourself, you can also help by sharing details of this study with anyone else who you think might be interested in taking part – the more people that take part, the more useful our results will be.
     </ul>

     <p>
     <b>What you will do:</b>
     <p>

     <ul>
        <li>You will complete a memory exercise that can take up to 25mins, then come back to this website for 3 minutes after 1 hour and after 24 hours - it is <b>very important</b> to do all three phases so that we can look at how memory CHANGES over time.
     </ul>

     <p>
     <b>What you will get after completing all three phases:</b>
     <p>

     <ul>
        <li>You will get your memory score immediately.
        <li>You can request a personalised report showing how your memory compares to all the other people people who have taken our test as well as how it compares to people of your own age group.
	<li>Guidance on how to improve your memory.
     </ul>
